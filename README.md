# LoopMachine

This loop machine simulates a Looper - a tool for creating music loops and plays recordings back in real-time.

By clicking on one of the pad loops, the loop will start playing and the pad will turn green.
You can stop the loop any time, by clicking the pad loop again. 
If you click on one of the pad loops while other loops are playing, it will move to pending state (red color), and will start playing its loop only on the
next loop cycle.
